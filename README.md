In this project, you will translate the design above into HTML and CSS code.

# Prerequisites
Your first task is to complete the HTML code for Pete's portfolio page. Then you will style the page with CSS. Next, you will use a HTML validator to verify the HTML page for syntax errors. Finally, you will display your work on GitHub.io.

# HTML5 Requirements
1. Pete's image can be found in the images/ folder, titled pete-thinkful.png. You should set the alt text of the image element to Pete Thinkful.
2. Pressing the About navigation link should take the site visitor to the About section.
3. In the "Please feel free to take a look at my website and feel free to contact me." text, the "contact me" part should be a link that, when pressed, takes the site visitor to the Contact section of the page.
4. "Producing abstract art," "Creating street graffiti art," and "Connecting with like-minded artists" should be displayed as a bulleted list.
5. Pressing the Contact navigation link should take the site visitor to the Contact section.
6. "LinkedIn," "Instagram," and "Pinterest" should be displayed as a numbered list of anchor elements. The href values may be left empty.
7. The About, Hi! I'm Pete Thinkful, and Pete's Background headings, as well as Pete's image, should be horizontally centered on the page.
8. The About heading should use a larger font size than the Hi! I'm Pete Thinkful and Pete's Background subheadings.
9. Pete's image should be completely round and have a border that is 2px wide with a color of #003049. To achieve this, you may add the necessary CSS rules to the .image-circle class that's already provided for you.
